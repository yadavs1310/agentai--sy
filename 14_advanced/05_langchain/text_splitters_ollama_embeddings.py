# -----------------------------
# 1. RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
# Splits purely on SIZE: tries to cut on paragraph breaks first, then
# sentences, then words, then characters - falling back down that list of
# separators only when a chunk is still too big. It has no idea what the
# text is ABOUT, so with a small enough chunk_size it will happily cut a
# chunk in half mid-topic, as long as it's under the character limit.
# -----------------------------

# -----------------------------
# 2. SemanticChunker
# Embeds each sentence, then looks at how much the embedding changes from
# one sentence to the next. A big jump = a topic boundary ("breakpoint"),
# and that's where it cuts - regardless of resulting chunk size. This is
# why, on the text above, it should produce exactly 3 chunks lining up
# with the 3 topics, instead of cutting mid-sentence like the splitter above.
#
# Third embeddings option: OllamaEmbeddings runs fully locally against a
# local Ollama server instead of HuggingFace (local sentence-transformers
# download) or OpenAI (paid API). Requires Ollama running and the model
# pulled first: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`.
